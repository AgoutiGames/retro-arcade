# SalmonEngine
This template project is a wrapper for the [RawSalmonEngine](https://github.com/AgoutiGames/RawSalmonEngine) dedicated as a starting point for developing games with it and making it as user friendly as possible.
## Dependencies
* **[RawSalmonEngine](https://github.com/AgoutiGames/RawSalmonEngine)**
* **including its dependencies as well**
## Compile and install
* Generally you can just use the bash scripts in the [scripts folder](/scripts)
* See [COMPILATION](/COMPILATION) for details
## Usage
For arranging game scenes the [Tiled map editor](http://www.mapeditor.org) is used. Scripts get attached to tile objects by matching Type field with the Class name of a Character class. Scripting is done in a Unity like fashion by writing update functions for game character or game scene classes. Easily generate each by executing the supplied python scripts in the respective directory. Further information including a tutorial with screenshots is planned to be written in the wiki section of this and/or the [RawSalmonEngine](https://github.com/AgoutiGames/RawSalmonEngine) repository. But until it's done you best look at [Calaveras](https://github.com/AgoutiGames/Calaveras) or other recent game projects of this organisation to get a grasp of how to use the engine.
